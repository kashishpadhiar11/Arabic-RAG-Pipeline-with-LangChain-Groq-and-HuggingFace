A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline designed for Arabic-language content using state-of-the-art large language model tools. This project integrates:
-  HuggingFace sentence-transformers for text embeddings
-  FAISS for vector similarity search
-  LangChain for chaining and orchestration
-  Groq API for fast LLM inference
-  PyPDF2 for parsing Arabic PDF documents
-  Retry logic with exponential backoff for robust API calls

Ideal for tasks like Arabic document understanding, search, and LLM-based Q&A.
